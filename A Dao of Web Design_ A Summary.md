# A **Dao** of **Web** **Design**: A Summary
>Original article written by *John Allsopp*

**John Allsopp** uses daoistic teachings from *Tao Te Ching* to summarize how he lives and creates on the digital world. He describes the relationship between print and web as one would with a parent and child; one stems from the other or is a continuation of its practices and teachings. 
Without print, web would have no guidelines to follow and emulate. Print itself is structured; it is constrained to a specific size, specific paper stock, specific choice of words, or how the editor and designer want the specific product to look/read/behave once it gets into the hands of the end user. 
Allsopp wants us to remove ourselves from that, and consider not the aesthetics of the design and how we want our product to be viewed first, but to take the end user into consideration. Allsopp wants us to *“let go of control”*, and to become *“flexible”* with how we design our products to be viewed in the end. 
Throwing away the limitation of structure and emphasizing the importance of *adaptability, accessibility and flexibility* one could have when the experience can be custom tailored to everyone.
